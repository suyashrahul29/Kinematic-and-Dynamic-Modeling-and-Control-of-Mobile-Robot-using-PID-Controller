# Abstract

This project explores the principles of mobile robot kinematics, dynamics, and control to enable accurate path following.
Utilizing MATLAB for software simulation, kinematic and dynamic models are refined before hardware implementation on the Arduino Nano platform. 
By distinguishing between software and hardware components, the project aims to bridge theory with practical application, contributing to advancements in robotic navigation systems.


# Introduction

In the realm of robotics, understanding the intricate interplay between kinematics, dynamics, and control is essential for the seamless navigation of mobile robots.
This project embarks on a comprehensive exploration of these fundamental principles, with a specific focus on wheeled mobile robots.
Our objective is to develop and refine kinematic and dynamic models, coupled with a robust controller, to facilitate accurate path following.
The journey begins in the realm of software, where MATLAB serves as our primary tool for simulation and model development.
Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, we refine our models to ensure optimal performance and reliability.
This software phase allows us to explore various scenarios, fine-tune parameters, and validate our approaches before transitioning to hardware implementation.
With our software models perfected, the focus shifts to hardware integration using the Arduino Nano platform.
This phase bridges theory with practical application, as we translate our meticulously designed algorithms into real-world robotic systems.
By distinguishing between the software and hardware components of our project, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical foundations and the practical considerations involved in achieving accurate path following for wheeled mobile robots.
